Integration-Testing-Out-of-the-Box
==================================

A Visual Studio C# Selenium WebDriver testing application that works out of the box to test any site

Test project can run as a part of a CI Server build process.

NOTE:  Out of the Box, this project will require Mozilla Firefox be installed on your test machine.
However, with a change to one line of code, you can use Chrome or Internet Explorer.

==================================

WARNING:  Out of the Box, this project contains a test which recursively goes through the specified site's domain and tests every link it finds.  If this will cause loss of data or changes to data on your website, disable the test before running.
